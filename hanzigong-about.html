<a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/1419729.htm">Hanzigong (汉字宫)</a>
is a series of 720 short videos which teaches 3000 or so Chinese characters.
Some episodes were aired in Thailand after soap dramas, so many Thai people know about it.
In my opinion, the series might not be the best for absolute beginners as 
(1) it does not order the characters by difficulty or commonness (一 is taught in episode 703), and
(2) it misses a lot of common characters
like 对, 再, and 年.
On the other hand, the series is great for people who already know some characters
and want to learn more characters in a systematic way.

I am especially impressed by how they arrange the characters:
starting from episode 48, the characters are grouped based on their "cores"
(usually the phonetic parts but not always; e.g., 日: 旦昌旭时间晶旧...),
and then the groups are arranged into themes (e.g., 日 is grouped with 月夕气云雨...).
Most cores are introduced in the first 48 episodes.

Due to Han Unification, you will need proper font settings for Chinese and Japanese to view this page correctly. 
The bottom of 直 should be a straight line, not an L.
