  <h2>How to use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The PDFs were scanned from my notebooks. Please view in <strong>dual mode with title page</strong>
      to match the book layout.</li>
    <li>Right pages are the main characters (~1000 in total), which include the characters from
      my textbooks and lower JLPT levels. Left pages are the supplementary characters.</li>
    <li>Characters are mostly grouped based on the non-radical component
      (which is usually the sound component). The groups are then ordered by themes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Book 1:</strong>
          Nature, Plant, Animal, Posture, Family, Society, Head</li>
        <li><strong>Book 2:</strong>
          Hand, Body, Home, Work, Weapon, Place, Abstract</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Symbols:
      <ul>
        <li>★: out-of-order; should be moved to a different place</li>
        <li>☉: should move from left page to right page (or vice-versa)</li>
        <li>Underlined word: key onyomi word; remember the on-reading from this word</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I started making this in 2012 and finished this in 2014,
      but an earlier draft can be traced back to 2010 when I started learning Japanese.</li>
    <li>Main inspirations include:
      <ul>
        <li>Other works that illustrate kanji as pictures, specifically
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kanji-Pict-Graphix-Japanese-Mnemonics/dp/0962813702">Kanji Pict-O-Graphix</a>,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kanji-MangaLand-1-Japanese/dp/4889962212">Kanji in MangaLand</a>,
        <a href="http://www.47news.jp/feature/47school/kanji/index.php">Kanji Monogatari</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Chinese-Characters-Huay-Peng/dp/981013004X">Fun With Chinese Characters</a></li>
      <li>Joint kanji-vocab learning system from
        <a href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a></li>
      <li>Character grouping and ordering from
        <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B1%89%E5%AD%97%E5%AE%AB">Hanzigong</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>The images are purely mnemonic. Sometimes they coincide with real origins,
      but most of them do not. For real origins, please consult resources like:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/">漢語多功能字庫: Multi-function Chinese Character Database</a> (Recommended): Probably the most comprehensive resource. Compiles and summarizes the work by various modern researchers, but is in Chinese.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Writing-Early-Special-Monograph/dp/1557290717">Chinese Writing</a> by Qiu Xigui (裘锡圭): Overview of the more recent studies of Chinese characters</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Japanese-Kanji-Understanding/dp/4805311703/">Japanese Kanji</a> by Seely and Henshall: Compilation of kanji interpretations, mainly following the phonetic theory of Toudou Akiyasu (藤堂明保)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/">Outlier Dictionary</a>: Character origin dictionary based mainly on the line of research by Chi Hsu-Sheng (季旭昇)</li>
      </ul>
      Note that character origin research is still an on-going work,
      and there are a lot of resources that provide false origins or older interpretations based on Shuowen Jiezi,
      so please be careful.
      <span class="sidenote">(I also do not believe in Shirakawa's theory, which seems to be the most popular in Japan.)</span></li>
    <li>There a lots of mistakes, missing characters, and mnemonics that I want to change.
      These issues will (probably) get fixed in the next version</li>
    <li>Feel free to contact <a href="index.html">me</a> if there is any concern.</li>
